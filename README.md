> **Mission**: To accelerate global AI innovation by delivering high-quality labeled data through a gamified, decentralized platform.

## 🧠 The Problem

AI development depends on high-quality labeled data, but current data labeling is:  
- Manual  
- Slow  
- Costly  
- Not scalable  

80% of time in an ML pipeline is spent on **data preparation** — the biggest bottleneck in AI innovation.

---

## 🎯 Our Solution

**Akai Space** leverages **gamification** and **community participation** to create a scalable, API-driven platform for reliable labeled data.

### 🧩 Key Components

- **Customer Platform**: API + dashboard to send and track data  
- **Labeler Platform**: Onboarding + tools for high-quality labeling  
- **AI Engine**: Pre-labeling + error correction + efficiency tools  
- **Gamification Layer**: Play-to-earn mechanics to engage users and scale labeling

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. Companies send data through our **API/Platform**.  
2. Gamified experiences onboard everyday users as **data labelers**.  
3. Our **AI engine** pre-labels data and flags errors to enhance quality.  
4. Users label data via **in-game challenges**.  
5. Labeled data is returned via API — fast, cost-effective, and scalable.
